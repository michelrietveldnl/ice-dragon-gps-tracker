The Ice Dragon GPS Tracker was written for a high altitude balloon project launched at the end of 2012.  The tracker was used record the flight path of the balloon as well as report back its location once it returned to the ground.

The tracker would work well for a number of other settings such as boating, hiking, or anywhere you would like to track location.
